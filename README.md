# sfcc-academy-leonam-loureiro
OSF Frontend Academy

The repository contains files made at the academy in February 2022. The main contains only the base sfcc files and in each of the 9 branches (except main) there is an exercise performed by me. And in each pull request it is possible to see the changes made at the time and the final result.
